    About Kamalify

    <p>
      We love things that are simple, practical, and straightforward. Thatâ€™s what Kamal is all about â€” and exactly what we want Kamalify to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kamal was built to make deployments easy, whether to the cloud or your own servers. It works just as well for a first-time deploy as it does when migrating infrastructure later on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, weâ€™ve tried many deployment tools, but Kamal hits the sweet spot between simplicity and power. Thatâ€™s what inspired us to build Kamalify.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kamalify takes that simplicity even further. <strong>It helps developers create a working Kamal config by just filling out a form</strong>. We know experienced devs might not need it â€” but if you're just starting out or want to set up a basic config quickly, it can save you time and headaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kamalify is <a href="#" class="cursor-pointer text-orange-600" targe="blank">open source</a>, so we can improve it together and build the best companion tool for configuring Kamal in our projects.
